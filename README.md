# WebProject #DoingListApp
A simple short summary of basic functionalities of the app and what knowledge it takes to create as a backend website implementations.


-->>It's a simple To Do List App which helps you to keep track of Your daily day to day work without deleting previous data once the tab is removed.
Currently using free online database server by MongoDB atlas and for universal deployment of this web app used Heroku PaaS 
Link : "https://doinglistapp.herokuapp.com/"
      SOME FUNCTIONALITIES :
1. By Clicking On New Item Tab , you can add your work in this list.
2. Whenever you want to remove some items from the current list , just go and click on the checkbox provided in the left side.
3. For Diffrent Users , You can create a newly different page by adding name just after last '/' in the link ,
   for e.g; Using "https://doinglistapp.herokuapp.com/College" will create a new page with Heading as "College",
   where you can restart from the defualt options and make changes to it.
   
What I have used and learned :
> Node.js , 
> MongoDB (Along with creating , storing , fetching data from a remote online database using "MongoDB Atlas" ) , 
> Deploying my web on remote online server "Heroku" (for anytime access) , 
> Git , GitHub And Version Control , 
> Express.js , 
> EJS , 
> JavaScript , 
> HTML , 
> CSS

Just tried to implement the basic things which can be done using backend creating multiple web pages using EJS from same CSS Template , 
Taking User's input and storing and then again fetching from an online database
Deleting from Database and Removing from list of user using the checkbox .

Thanks !!
